const about = `
\nSoftware is all about people, and I try to write code with that in mind. As an engineer
I seek out opportunities for growth through challenge. Writing code everyday
allows me to challenge myself and creating things that effect, and hopefully improve, the
lives of others. Even better I get to do it with other masochists. Maybe someday I can write
code with you?
